The Static Site Project

As artists, we are often at the forefront of change, and with the relentless
advancement and adoption of technology, we should take some time to ask questions.

This template is intended for use by artists who are interested in gaining a better
understanding of the digital systems that we use to promote, share, or sell our work.

It is written in HTML and CSS.

It is a static website.

It encourages digital stewardship.

It opens the door for alternatives to large-scale corporate run website building
and hosting services; instead placing control firmly back into the hands of the artist.

This version of the site (001) was introduced in the spring of 2024 by Dev Wiggers.

many comments as possible. The goal is that you will be able to quickly build
on this template as needed, and customize it to your own personal needs.
