<h1>On Digital Technology</h1>
<p class="limit">This website, as you may have noticed,looks a bit different. There isn't a whole lot going on,
  and, for someone who claims to be a visual artist, the images shown are, wonky, at best.
  As artists, we are often at the forefront of change, and with the relentless advancement and adoption of technology,
   we should take some time to ask questions.</p>

<br>
       <h3 class="headlimit">3-6%</h3>
      <p class="limit">Is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the internet, the same as the airline industry.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="headlimit">20%</h3>
      <p class="limit">The amount of global electricity the internet is projected to use by 2025. </p>
      <h3 class="headlimit">DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS ARE AS REAL AS PHYSICAL ONES</h3>
      <p class="limit">As artists, we are encouraged to heavily use social media,
  put out high-quality images onto the web, and generally, just create an internet presence.
  This is really, really useful, especially if you're an establishing artist (like me).</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="headlimit">REDUCED-LOADS</h3>
      <p class="limit">Building a lightweight, static website, like this one, reduces our impact.
Dithering images, using compressed images, and only sending them out when we really need to, reduces our impact.
Reducing reliance on large corporations for our web-needs reduces our impact.
Switching from an "always-online" mentality, to a "downtime-is-good" mentality, reduces our impact.</p>
