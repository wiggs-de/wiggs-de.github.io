<p class=”limitbig”> THIS WEBSITE, as you may have noticed,looks a bit different. There isn't a whole lot going on,
  and, for someone who claims to be a visual artist, the images shown are, wonky, at best.
  As artists, we are often at the forefront of change, and with the relentless advancement and adoption of technology,
   we should take some time to ask questions. </p>
   <br>
<p class=”limitbig”>   Our digital footprint is every bit as real as our physical one. As artists, we are encouraged to heavily use social media,
  put out high-quality images onto the web, and generally, just create an internet presence.
  This is really, really useful, especially if you're an establishing artist (like me). </p>
  <br>
<p class=”limitbig”> One way is to reduce the load of our digital services. Building a lightweight, static website, like this one, reduces our impact.
Dithering images, using compressed images, and only sending them out when we really need to, reduces our impact.
Reducing reliance on large corporations for our web-needs reduces our impact.
Switching from an "always-online" mentality, to a "downtime-is-good" mentality, by implementing solar-powered home servers, reduces our impact. </p>



              <h4> We, as artists, have the capability and opportunity to enact change, we only require the agency and intent. </h4>
